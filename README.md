# Evaluating-ADME-properties-for-Neprilysin-

In this code we built a machine learning model to predict to potency of chemical coumpounds based on (pIC50) index against Neprilysin. The inhibition of Neprilysin topically is very important in anti-aging process, because it degrades various bioactive peptides, involved in inflammation and collagen degradation.
